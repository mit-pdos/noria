                //  - we know that there is only exactly one full replay going on
                //  - we know that the target domain buffers any messages not tagged as
                //    replays once it has seen the *first* replay
                //  - we know that the target domain will apply all bufferd messages after it sees
                //    last = true
                //
                // we therefore have two jobs to do:
                //
                //  1. ensure that we only send one message with last = true.
                //  2. ensure that all messages we forward after we allow the first replay message
                //     through logically follow the replay.
                //
                // step 1 is pretty easy -- we only set last = true when we've seen last = true
                // from all our ancestors. until that is the case, we just set last = false in all
                // our outgoing messages (even if they had last set).
                //
                // step 2 is trickier. consider the following in a union U
                // across two ancestors, L and R:
                //
                //  1. L sends first replay
                //  2. L sends a normal message
                //  3. R sends a normal message
                //  4. R sends first replay
                //  5. U receives L's replay
                //  6. U receives R's message
                //  7. U receives R's replay
                //
                // when should U emit the first replay? if it does it eagerly (i.e., at 1), then
                // R's normal message at 3 (which is also present in R's replay) will be buffered
                // and replayed at the target domain, since it comes after the first replay
                // message. instead, we must delay sending the first replay until we have seen the
                // first replay from *every* ancestor. in other words, 1 must be captured, and only
                // emitted at 5. unfortunately, 2 also wants to cause us pain. it must *not* be
                // sent until after 5 either, because otherwise it would be dropped by the target
                // domain, which is *not* okay since it is not included in L's replay.
                //
                // phew.
                //
                // first, how do we emit *two* replay messages at 5? it turns out that we're in
                // luck. because only one replay can be going on at a time, the target domain
                // doesn't actually care about which tag we use for the forward (well, as long as
                // it is *one* of the full replay tags). and since we're a union, we can simply
                // fold 1 and 4 into a single update, and then emit that!
                //
                // second, how do we ensure that 2 also gets sent *after* the replay has started.
                // again, we're in luck. we can simply absorb 2 into the replay when we detect that
                // there's a replay which hasn't started yet! we do that above (in the other match
                // arm). feel free to go check. interestingly enough, it's also fine for us to

                // remember how, above, we stripped out the upquery identifier from the replay's
                // tag? consider what happens if we buffer a replay with, say, tag 7.2 (so, upquery
                // 7, path 2). later, when some other replay comes along with, say, tag 7.1, we
                // decide that we're done buffering. we then release the buffered records from the
                // first replay alongside the ones that were in the 7.1 replay. but, we just
                // effectively _changed_ the tag for the records in that first replay! is that ok?
                // it turns out it _is_, and here is the argument for why:
                //
                // first, for a given upquery, let's consider what paths flow through us when there
                // is only a single union on the upquery's path. we know there is then one path for
                // each parent we have. an upquery from below must query each of our parents once
                // to get the complete results. those queries will all have the same upquery id,
                // but different path ids. since there is no union above us or below us on the
                // path, there are exactly as many paths as we have ancestors, and those paths only
                // branch _above_ us. below us, those different paths are the _same_. this means
                // that no matter what path discriminator we forward something with, it will follow
                // the right path.
                //
                // now, what happens if there is a exactly one union on the upquery's path, at or
                // above one of our parents. well, _that_ parent will have as many distinct path
                // identifiers as that union has parents. we know that it will only produce _one_
                // upquery response through (since the union will buffer), and that the repsonse
                // will have (an arbitrary chosen) one of those path identifiers. we know that path
                // discriminators are distinct, so whichever identifier our union ancestor chooses,
                // it will be distinct from the paths that go through our _other_ parents.
                // furthermore, we know that all those path identifiers ultimately share the same
                // path below us. and we also know that the path identifiers of the paths through
                // our other parents share that same path. so choosing any of them is fine.
                //
                // if we have unions above multiple of our parents, the same argument holds.
                //
                // if those unions again have ancestors that are unions, the same argument holds.
                //
                // the missing piece then is how a union that has a union as a _descendant_ knows
                // that any choice it makes for path identifier is fine for that descendant. this
                // is trickier to argue, but the argument goes like this:
                //
                // imagine you have a union immediately followed by a union, followed by some node
                // that wishes to make an upquery. imagine that each union has two incoming edges:
                // the bottom union has two edges to the top union (a "diamond"), and the top union
                // has two incoming edges from disjoint parts of the graph. i don't know why you'd
                // have that, but let's imagine. for the one upquery id here, there are four path
                // identifiers: bottom-left:top-left, bottom-left:top-right, bottom-right:top-left,
                // and bottom-right:top-right. as the top union, we will therefore receive two
